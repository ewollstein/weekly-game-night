			Welcome to Game Night! We're glad you got the invite & hope you enjoy 
			yourself! 
		</p>
		<p class="home">
			This all started with booze, cigars, and darts in Tre's garage, 
			then grew to include Magic: The Gathering online before finally 
			taking shape as the table-top gaming group you see today. Notice 
			the use of the term "table-top" instead of board games? That's 
			because many of the games we play don't use a board! Some use cards, 
			some use dice, some use tokens, and of course various combinations 
			of each.
		</p>
		<p class="home">
			If you aren't familiar with these kinds of games, that's okay! We 
			have our <a href="games.html">Library</a> page with a short 
			description of each game & links to various resources to help you 
			understand them. That should help if there's anything you're curious 
			about before game night rolls around. There should also be links 
			for gameplay videos since most of them sound more complicated on 
			paper than they are hands-on.
		</p>
		<p class="home">
			Even though we have a decent collection of games already, if you 
			have something you'd rather play or think we'd enjoy, feel free to 
			bring it along! We're usually pretty open to new games & themes to 
			mix into the rotation. Don't worry if its a little complicated, 
			Eric can always do the math & keep track of the rules (Dammit, Eric)!
