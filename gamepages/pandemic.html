				<h2>Style: Co-operative</h2>
				<h2>Players: 2-4</h2>
				<p class="games" >
					Pandemic is a co-operative strategy game where each player chooses a role with a unique ability and they team up to find cures for four diseases around the world. You have to balance the need to treat infected cities & the race to develop a cure to eradicate the disease entirely before outbreaks claim the world!
				</p>
				<p class="games">
					Players get four actions each turn that they can use to move, treat infections, trade cards, or develop the cure to a disease. After these actions they draw two cards for their hand, then play a number of cards from the infection deck based on the current threat level. The regions of the world have different colors of diseases that naturally occurs there & that is reflected on the cards in the playersâ€™ hands. If you can match 5 cards of the same color, you can go to a city with a research station to develop the cure! Cure all 4 diseases and save the world!
