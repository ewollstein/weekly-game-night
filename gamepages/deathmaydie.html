				<h1 class="games">Cthulhu: Death May Die</h1>
				<h2>Style: Co-operative</h2>
				<h2>Players: 1-5</h2>
				<p class="games">
					Elder Gods, time travel, dark rituals, detailed mini figures. What more could you want? Death May Die has players pick an adventurer from various points in time to interrupt a ritual to summon an Elder God into our world. The Old One is still coming either way, its too late to stop it completely. The best humanity can hope for is to keep them from coming back fully powered so they can be killed in the brief moment they are vulnerable. Are you up to the task?
				</p>
				<p class="games">
					The game is episode based, each episode being a different scenario & ritual for the players to disrupt. The episode dictates placement of the map tiles & details of what the players need to do to interrupt it. Players move through the rooms to explore & at the end of the turn, if the room they're in has an enemy, they have combat. If the room is epmty they can investigate to look for clues or items to help in thier mission. Finally they pull a Mythos card to see where new monsters or cultists show up & if the Old One moves closer to our world. Each of the characters has 3 powers to use, too. As you progress through the mission you'll start losing sanity. At certain sanity levels you'll be able to level up those powers to make them stronger so you can do more damage, run without enemies following you, or use special symbols on your dice rolls. Each character has one unique power & two generic abilities, but are also dealt a random character flaw card at the start of the game that will change how you play the game.
