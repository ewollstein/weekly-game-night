				<h1 class="games">The Reckoners</h1>
				<h2>Style: Co-Operative</h2>
				<h2>Players: 3-6</h2>
				<p class="games">We all know the stories of superheroes who gain powers and decide to use them to make the world  better place, to stand up for what's right, and protect the weak or defenseless. In The Reckoners, that paradigm is shifted in the opposide direction. A sudden event triggered powers in people called Epics. Steelheart is a massively powered Epic who has taken over the dystopian city of Newcago. He and his fellow Epics rule with iron fists, killing anyone who even remotely bothers them, until finally normal humans just accept this as their new reality. Enter our heroes...</p>
				<p class="games">The Reckoners are a band of unpowered humans who have had enough of the tyrannical regime and have banded together to fight back! The players use dice rolls to determine which actions they will take for the round in a roll & keep style, meaning you roll all available dice, keep at least 1, and reroll the rest. You get 3 rolls, and players can act independantly or use their dice to help other players. There are standard dice everyone gets, but each character also gets special dice based on their strengths, and equipment can be purchased between rounds to unlock extra dice or abilties.</p>
				<p class="games">Once the dice have all been rolled, players take turns using the dice to move around the city to take out henchmen, research weaknesses in the Epics, reign in their powers, remove barricades to areas of the city, or to make money to buy equipment cards. Players need to coordinate their efforts since some Epics can't be harmed until you research them or may need a barricade removed before they can move to a certain region. After all the players have gone, the Epics will perform their actions that might bring out more henchmen, build up barricades, power up Steelheart, heal themselves, or even kill civilians! If they kill too many civilians before finding Steelheart's weakness & defeating him, or the heroes will lose!</p>
