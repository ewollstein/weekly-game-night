				<h2>Style: Co-operative</h2>
				<h2>Players: 3-4</h2>
				<p class="games">
					There’s treasure on this island somewhere, and it's up to your team to find it! The problem is, there’s also a storm on the way & parts of the island are starting to flood. Each player picks a role with an extra ability, then they all take turns exploring the island trying to find the treasure. Find all the treasure and return to the chopper pad before the whole island sinks into the sea!
				</p>
				<p class="games">
					The map of the island takes the form of tiles with a normal side and a flooded side. Each turn the players can move, shore up a flooded tile, or turn in cards on a matching symbol tile to collect a treasure. Watch out, though, because at the end of the turn you also have to reveal cards from the flood deck to see which tiles get flooded that turn. If a tile is already flooded and it’s card comes up again, it gets washed away instead!
