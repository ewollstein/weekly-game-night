					<h2>Style: Competitive</h2>
					<h2>Players: 3-7</h2>
					<p class="games">
						This strategy game has the players act as architects of up to 7 classic historical civilizations, almost like a competitive Sim City or the Civilization video games. You decide whether to invest in infrastructure, military, or commerce. You can also build Wonders, as the name suggests, that carry over through the 3 Ages you play through, giving you unique bonuses. Gameplay may seem complex at first, and strategies certainly can be as complex as you dare, but turns being simultaneous means things go pretty fast so youâ€™ll see things in action really quick to pick it up.
					</p>
					<p class="games">
						Players take actions by playing cards. Cards are drawn from a drafting mechanic where cards are drawn from the deck of the current age equal to the number of players. The first player gets to see all of the cards, keep one, then pass the rest to the next player until everyone has drawn a card. After everyone gets a card, you play them & all get to collect or spend resources depending on the card played. When everyone has had a chance to play 6 cards, the age ends. Once you reach the end of the age, everyone adds up points from the cards they played & compares military might to get their score. At the end of the third age whoever gained the most points has the greatest civilization!
