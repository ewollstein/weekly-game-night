				<h2>Style: Competitive</h2>
				<h2>Players: 2-5</h2>
				<p class="games">
					The city of Waterdeep is one of the most iconic locations 
					in the Forgotten Realms of Dungeons & Dragons. In this game 
					you play one of the unseen Lords, controlling the city & its people from the shadows. There are times you will work with the other Lords to achieve a task, sometimes you'll work against them, and sometimes they'll throw a surprise to try and stop you!
				</p>
				<p class="games">
					This is a worker placement game with many options each turn 
					to assign your workers to. Should you recruit adventurers to send on quests? Maybe you should construct a new bulding? Would it be a better time for espionage & trickery? Each location on the board will help you gain resources, but most can only be used by one player per round. You have to plan carefully to make the most of your turn, but since each player can only place one worker at a a time you have to be flexible in case someone else takes a space before your turn. You have eight rounds to achieve your goals. Can you score enough points to become the most powerful Lord in the city?
