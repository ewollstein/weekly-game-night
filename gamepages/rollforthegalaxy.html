				<h2>Style: Competitive</h2>
				<h2>Players: 3-5</h2>
				<p class="games">
					Roll for the Galaxy is a dice and tile strategy game of building space empires. You control a populace that help you explore new territories, develop new technologies, settle alien worlds, produce goods, and ship those goods.
				</p>
				<p class="games">
					All players start the game with a personal game board, five white dice, a blind to roll the dice behind, a cup to help roll the dice, and a player marker. You begin by choosing two face-down starting tiles from the game box, these tiles start your space empire. You also choose two tiles from the bag for your initial setup & choose which technology to develop and which world to settle. Settling worlds give you more dice with different colors, each with their own theme, and worlds can produce goods that can be consumed for victory points or sold for cash. Technologies give you extra powers or rewards when different phases or actions take place.
				</p>
				<p class="games">
					Players take actions simultaneously starting with rolling the dice they have available. The rolls are hidden while you plan what to do with your dice. Players select one phase they want to happen, then arrange their dice according to the rest of the phases they rolled. Once everyone has made their decisions, each player reveals their dice to determine which phases will take place that round. Then everyone goes through each phase one at a time, using the dice they assigned to that phase. Once all the phases are resolved, place any unused dice from that turn back in your cup, use your money to buy back as many used dice as you can, then start another round. Play continues until there are no more victory points left or someone places their twelfth tile, then count up victory points & see who wins!
