				<h2>Style: Competitive</h2>
				<h2>Players: 3-4</h2>
				<p class="games">
					In Suburbia players compete to build the best town that draws in the highest population. Each building has its own cost to build, but also grants you benefits like earning you money to upgrade buildings later, or increase your reputation. In many ways it resembles the SIm City games, only played in a competitive, table-top format. Cities can also interact with each other in some ways and there are some common goals players can work towards for bonuses.
				</p>
				<p class="games">
					Each player has their own city area, and the buildings come as hexagonally shaped tiles. When you build a new structure, you place its tile so that the edges line up with at least one existing tile in your town. Planning is key, as some structures adjacent to others can give benefits to your reputation, while others may harm it. While money is certainly necessary to create a sprawling metropolis, a good reputation is whatâ€™s going to draw people in to increase your population!
