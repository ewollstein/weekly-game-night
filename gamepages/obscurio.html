				<h1 class="games">Obscurio</h1>
				<h2>Style: Both</h2>
				<h2>Players: 2-8</h2>
				<p class="games">Obscurio is what would happen if you tried an escape room designed by an evil sorcerer, and all the puzzles were a game of Pictionary. Oh, and one of the players is mind controlled by the evil sorcerer...</p>
				<p class="games">Obscurio is an asymetrical game, which means some of the players use different rules to play the game. In this case one player takes on the role of the Grimiore, the sentient spellbook the players are trying to steal from the evil sorcerer's twisted library. The Grimiore gives clues in the form of visual hints as to which of the 6 doors leads to the exit. The hints can only be visual, though! There's a deck of Illusion cards that represent the rooms beyond the doors. each round the Grimoire will draw one hidden from the other players & it becomes the exit for the round. Then 2 more cards are drawn & the Grimoire places pointers at whatever objects they think are the best clues to match the exit card. The players get to look at those hints & discuss them before the rest of the room cards are drawn, but the Grimoire muct remain silent!</p>
                <p class="games">There's a twist to all this, though! that mind controlled player acts as a traitor & tries to sabotage the other players! Each round you'll need 6 cards to represent the rooms. 1 is the card the Grimoire drew at the start, but after the clues are revealed the players all close their eyes. Durin this time, the traitor can choose upt to 2 rooms to add to the deck with the correct exit. Then everyone opens their eyes & the rest of the rooms are drawn & shuffled together with the exit & rooms the traitor chose.</p>
                <p class="games">As soon as the players place the first room on the board the Grimoire starts the 1 minute timer to put the pressure on the players as they try to decide which room to go to! The players don't all have to choose the same room, but each time someone chooses the wrong room the players lose a cohesion token. These are markers to represent how well the group is working together, and losing all of them will cost the players the game as they splinter off & wander the library alone forever!</p>
