				<h2>Style: Competitive</h2>
				<h2>Players: 2-4</h2>
				<p class="games">
					Who doesn't want to be a Viking chief? In Champions of Midgard that's exactly the goal! This is what's known as a "worker placement" game, the idea being that the board has various stations to perform certain tasks. On their turn, each player may place one of their workers on an available station to collect resources or send their warriors into battle against an enemy of the village! Make decisions wisely, most board locations can only be used once per round! Each round the players take turns assigning all of their workers & collecting resources along the way. Any warriors used to attack an enemy must be assigned when you place your worker, but combat doesn't happen until the end of the round. Once combat is over, each player collects their workers from the board & all of the stations get reset. After eight rounds the players take turns counting up bonus points & the player with the highest score is the new Chief!
				</p>
				<p class="games">
					Your viking warriors are represented by dice of different colors, some of which can't be used against certain enemies. Enemies take the form of a Troll, two Drauger, and up to four Monsters. Defeating the different enemies gives you rewards like gold & glory. You can also try for secret bonuses from Fate cards that might get you extra glory at the end of the game. There is also the dreaded blame! If a Troll goes undefeated then all the players get a blame token that reduces their score at the end of the game. The points you lose ramp up with each blame token, but if you're the one to defeat the Troll that round, you can give one of your blame tokens to another player.
