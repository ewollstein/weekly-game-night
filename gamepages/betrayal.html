				<h2>Style: Both</h2>
				<h2>Players: 3-6</h2>
				<p class="games">
					Betrayal at House on the Hill is a tile game that allows players to build their own haunted house room by room, tile by tile, creating a new house and game every time. The game consists of a deck of room tiles (upper floor, ground floor, and basement), three sets of cards for Items, Events, and Omens, six different characters, and a number of tokens to represent the players and various monsters or items.
				</p>
				<p class="games">
					During the course of the game, each player will use the stats from their characters to explore the house and uncover items, events, and omens (based on the text on each tile). Each omen they come across brings the players come closer to finding out which of the players is secretly the traitor. When the players come across omen cards, they must do the text on the card and then make a “haunt roll”. This roll determines when and where the traitor emerges.
				</p>
				<p class="games">
					After the haunt, the rules to the game and the previous strategy you had completely change based on how the traitor is revealed, and who becomes the traitor. Survive the night in the haunted house with the traitor to win. Or, on the flip side, if you become the traitor, defeat the rest of the party to win. Who will betray who? What evil spirit or creature is now after you? Will you survive or perish? Find out in the house on the hill.
