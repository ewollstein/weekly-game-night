					Marvel Champions is what's known as a living card game. This means the core set gives you everything you need to build your starting decks and expansions add new heroes or villains and cards to add into your decks. Unlike collectable card games, packs don't have random cards to chase. You will still construct a deck for each hero and they all have specific cards, like Iron Man's armor. Cards can be swapped out, so the decks aren't fixed & you can make adjustments if you find there's a card you don't use often enough or just want to try something else.
				</p>
				<p class="games">
					The game plays out with the villain having its own deck with different types of cards to play. Some are scheme cards representing their evil plans, some are henchmen, and some are direct attacks. Players use a power called Thwart to overcome the schemes & remove them from play, including any lingering effects they have. Players can also use their attack power, or that of any allies they have in play, to directly damage the boss or his minions. Each person's turn a new villain card will be played and its up to the players to decide what to deal with first. Once the villain has taken enough damage they will switch to a different version & give the players a new set of challenges until they ultimately save the day!
