				<h2>Style: Competitive</h2>
				<h2>Players: 2-4</h2>
				<p class="games">
					Castles of Mad King Ludwig is a game where players spend gold to buy rooms & build the wildest castle they can think of! Players take turns buying & placing rooms through connected doorways & scoring points. They also have secret goals to score bonus points at the end of the game, and the player with the most points wins the contract to build the king his new castle!
				</p>
				<p class="games">
					Each turn begins by revealing a number of different sized & shaped rooms for the players to choose from. One player, the Master Builder, arranges them on a cost scale. The rest of the players take turns paying the Master Builder for a room & placing it in their castle. The Master Builder goes last & pays the bank, then passes the Master Builder token to the next player & another round begins! When there are no more rooms to be placed everyone gets a final round then everyone counts up their points!
