				<h2>Style: Both</h2>
				<h2>Players: 3-7</h2>
				<p class="games">
					Your team is trapped on a lunar mining base, but something more than ore was waiting in those mines. Something that infected members of your crew. Part of the problem is that you’re not sure who is infected. Is it the medic? Maybe the shield technician? Is it the Commander? The other big problem is that systems are failing around the base, some are normal parts of the operation, but some could be sabotage. One thing’s for sure, you’re going to have to work together if you’re going to hold the base together long enough for the rescue team to arrive. The tasks necessary will be tough enough, but it gets a lot harder when you don’t know who you can trust!	
				</p>
				<p class="games">
					At the beginning of the game players choose which member of the crew they want to be. Once everyone has a character, you all get a card that tells you if you’re a normal human or an infected traitor. Everyone has to take 30 seconds to look at their card & can’t put it down until the timer runs out, that way no one knows whether the other players are traitors or not. Players have a dice pool to represent their resources & keep those dice behind a blind, so the type, quantity, and value of each of their rolls are hidden. On each player’s turn they may attempt to complete challenges & other players can choose to help or not. If they do decide to help, they have to contribute at least one die to the total for the challenge. Be careful, though, because all dice have positive and negative numbers on them, so if you roll poorly you may end up hurting the team instead! But maybe you are infected and that was your plan all along! Complete enough challenges & you survive long enough to be rescued, but if you fail too many or enough components of the base are destroyed then your whole crew is lost!
