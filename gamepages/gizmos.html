                    Want to play mad scientist? That's the theme of Gizmos. This is an "engine builder" game, so the idea is to have multiple gizmo cards that trigger chain reactions based on which action you take on your turn. Each gizmo has a different trigger & effect, so plan accordingly! There are 3 levels of Gizmos to build with stronger powers and worth more victory points, but also at an increased cost. Play lasts until someone builds their 3rd level 3 gizmo, or 16 total gizmos. Then everyone counts up their victory points & whoever has the most wins the blue ribbon at the science fair!

                    Resources take the form of colored marbles, representing different power sources. The different colors are used to pay for the gizmo cards, but the colors don't have unique powers by themselves. Gizmo powers are triggered by either picking up a specific color marble, building a colored gizmo, or just by taking certain actions. Powers range from upgrades to your resource capacity, picking extra marbles, or converting one color marble to another, to making gizmos cost less or getting extra victory points for building certain colors. You only get one action by default, but plan your gizmos right & you may end up taking 6-7 in one turn or building something & gaining more marbles than it cost to buy it!
