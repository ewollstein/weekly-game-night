				<h2>Style: Competitive</h2>
				<h2>Players: 3-4</h2>
				<p class="games">
					Would you rather trade goods or steal them? Make that decision here, just like the title says! This game is a bit more complex, as there are many options available to players each round. Each player has a ship & starts off with goods for trade. The board has many ports the players can sail to, and each one has different goods in demand, ship upgrades, and a different empire that controls the port. Sell your goods for gold, buy more to fill your cargo hold, then sail on to another port! There are also missions available if you’re feeling bold! They offer various rewards like ship upgrades, gold, or a whole new ship! Take care where you sail, though, because pirates sail the high seas looking for merchants to rob!
				</p>
				<p class="games">
					Speaking of pirates, that’s an option for you, too. If you don’t like the slow route to build up your gold, you can always attack your fellow players & steal theirs! Attacking other ships will give you a bounty from that empire and you can’t dock in a port controlled by that empire, but there are always other places to dock. The roaming pirates won’t attack you, but there are ships from the fleets around, if you’re spotted by a ship under a flag you have a bounty from, they will attack you! Plan your routes carefully to avoid the armada or take cover in a port where all players are safe. Completing missions, uncovering rumors, turning in high value goods, and winning combat all reward Glory points, as does stashing gold to keep it safe from pirates. Try to get to 10 Glory first & show everyone you’re the best Captain in the sea!
