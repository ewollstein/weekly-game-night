				<h2>Style: Co-operative</h2>
				<h2>Players: 3-4</h2>
				<p class="games">
					Your team are members of an agency that tries to preserve timelines. You’ll get assignments that send you to the past, the future, or even other dimensions, as you try to solve a mystery & avert disaster! The method of time/dimension travel is to actually send your consciousness into the body of someone else. You’ll have to use that person’s abilities to explore & communicate with the locals to figure out what’s been going on & how to stop it, but be careful, because many of the characters you control will have weaknesses as well!
				</p>
				<p class="games">
					Players have a map to explore with many unique locations to visit. Each location has a group of cards that form a panoramic image with different areas to investigate. You never know where clues will show up or who may have information for you, but don’t take too long searching because you can only stay in these bodies for a limited time! Information on each card is only available to the players who visited that area, so it's up to the team to communicate what they uncover & piece together enough information to save the timeline!
