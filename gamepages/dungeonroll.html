				<h2>Style: Competitive</h2>
				<h2>Players: 3-5</h2>
				<p class="games">
					In Dungeon Roll the players each get a party leader card with a bonus power. At the start of the round they roll the Party dice to see which types of heroes make up their party. In addition to the hero types, they may also roll potions which can be used to bring dice that were already discarded, and scrolls that can be used to reroll any number of dice. Players then enter the dungeon on level one, where another player takes on the job of rolling for monsters. Level one they roll one Monster die, level two is two Monster dice, etc. Use your party dice to defeat monsters, open treasure chests, or take potions to complete the levels. Certain treasures can also be used as hero types if you have them. Take your party as far as you dare & collect experience for the last level you completed. Plan wisely, if you decide to try another level and canâ€™t complete it, you lose any experience you would have gained!
				</p>
				<p class="games">
					The character cards all have a basic power, but if you reach level 5 you can flip the card to the upgraded version for a more powerful ability. The Monster dice also have a dragon symbol, and if you end up with 3 of them, you have to face the dragon before you can take on the other monsters or collect rewards. Dragons require 3 different hero symbols to defeat, but you can experience and treasure immediately, regardless of the rest of that level. Everyone gets 3 turns to collect as much experience as possible, so dive as far as you can in the dungeons and collect as much treasure as you can!
