				<h2>Style: Competitive</h2>
				<h2>Players: 3-6</h2>
				<p class="games">
					This card game is based on Dungeons & Dragons, with a twist. Instead of beginning a campaign & working together to stop evil forces, you're jumping in at the end when you & the rest of your party has just defeated the dragon in his cave. The lair is full of gold & you're trying to figure out how to divide the loot, but greed has set in & all you can think now is to grab as much as you can and run for the entrance! Everyone has the same idea, so now a multi-wizard duel brakes out as everyone tries to get their hands on the treasure & hold back the other wizards! Wait, why is the party all wizards? Who cares, just get the gold!
				</p>
				<p class="games">
					Each player starts in the middle of the hallway with gold on one end & the entrance on the other. The first person to get 25 gold from the pile & make it to the other end to escape wins! As wizards, you also have a hand of cards for your spells to slow the other wizards down. Each spell has a hand gesture on it, so the turns start just like rock, paper, scissors, except everyone makes a gesture for the spell they want to cast while pointing that spell at the wizard they want to hit. Resolving the timing of certain spells can be tricky, but once it's all sorted out you'll see who moved in which direction, draw new cards, and try again!
