				<h2>Style: Competitive</h2>
				<h2>Players: 3-6</h2>
				<p class="games">
					Basically, this is Dungeons and Dragons “Lite”. Each player starts at level 1 and fight their way up to level 10. In doing so, they will have special armor, weapons, potions, and other things to help them along the way.
				</p>
				<p class="games">
					You start the game with both door cards and treasure cards; there are also two stacks of cards on the table, both doors and treasure. As the player, you put down any armor, weapons, or other items that can help you along the way - all using the same rules as most role playing games (1 armor, 2 hands, 1 headgear and so on). The main difference between most role playing games and this one is that this is a cooperative game, as well as a competitive game since you can attack other players to stop them from winning.
				</p>
				<p class="games">
					Your turn starts by you kicking down the door from the door stack that everyone can see. If it is a monster or a curse, that card takes effect immediately; otherwise, you keep it in your hand. You can then “look for trouble” (fight a monster card you have in your hand) or “loot the room” (draw another door card only you can see). One this order is complete, you discard your hand down to 5 cards and it is the next player’s turn. You gain levels by defeating monsters or by “gain a level” cards. This continues around the table until one of the players reaches level 10.
