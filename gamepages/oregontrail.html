				<h2>Style: Co-operative</h2>
				<h2>Players: 3-6</h2>
				<p class="games">
					This is a cooperative card game version of the computer game you loved as a kid. Letâ€™s face it, it was one of the only computer games back then! Work with your team to venture out on the Oregon Trail, but there are dangers everywhere. Do you have enough food? Can you successfully ford the river? What will you do if someone has dysentery? Do you have supplies to repair a broken wagon wheel?
				</p>
				<p class="games">
					Each player has cards in their hand for various situations & places a new card each turn to form the trail. Obstacles will come up & its up to the team to come up with the resources to get past them. If you come across a town you can also buy new supplies to keep the wagon train rolling.
