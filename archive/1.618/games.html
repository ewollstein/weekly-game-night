					<h2>Style: Competitive</h2>
					<h2>Players: 3-7</h2>
					<p class="games">
						This strategy game has the players act as architects of up to 7 classic historical civilizations, almost like a competitive Sim City or the Civilization video games. You decide whether to invest in infrastructure, military, or commerce. You can also build Wonders, as the name suggests, that carry over through the 3 Ages you play through, giving you unique bonuses. Gameplay may seem complex at first, and strategies certainly can be as complex as you dare, but turns being simultaneous means things go pretty fast so you’ll see things in action really quick to pick it up.
					</p>
					<p class="games">
						Players take actions by playing cards. Cards are drawn from a drafting mechanic where cards are drawn from the deck of the current age equal to the number of players. The first player gets to see all of the cards, keep one, then pass the rest to the next player until everyone has drawn a card. After everyone gets a card, you play them & all get to collect or spend resources depending on the card played. When everyone has had a chance to play 6 cards, the age ends. Once you reach the end of the age, everyone adds up points from the cards they played & compares military might to get their score. At the end of the third age whoever gained the most points has the greatest civilization!

					Ascension is a deck building game where each player will start with the same basic cards to damage monsters or to buy upgrade cards for their deck.

Some cards will also interfere with the plans of your opponents, allow you to draw extra cards, or gain new cards cheaper. Develop your own strategy to score more points than the other players!

				<h2>Style: Both</h2>
				<h2>Players: 3-6</h2>
				<p class="games">
					Betrayal at House on the Hill is a tile game that allows players to build their own haunted house room by room, tile by tile, creating a new house and game every time. The game consists of a deck of room tiles (upper floor, ground floor, and basement), three sets of cards for Items, Events, and Omens, six different characters, and a number of tokens to represent the players and various monsters or items.
				</p>
				<p class="games">
					During the course of the game, each player will use the stats from their characters to explore the house and uncover items, events, and omens (based on the text on each tile). Each omen they come across brings the players come closer to finding out which of the players is secretly the traitor. When the players come across omen cards, they must do the text on the card and then make a “haunt roll”. This roll determines when and where the traitor emerges.
				</p>
				<p class="games">
					After the haunt, the rules to the game and the previous strategy you had completely change based on how the traitor is revealed, and who becomes the traitor. Survive the night in the haunted house with the traitor to win. Or, on the flip side, if you become the traitor, defeat the rest of the party to win. Who will betray who? What evil spirit or creature is now after you? Will you survive or perish? Find out in the house on the hill.

					Remember the old classic side-scrolling video games like Metroid, Mega Man, or Castlevania? This is a lot like that except instead of being the brave adventurer exploring some ruins, you get to be the villain! Everyone gets a boss villain & starting hand of cards. Cards can be either rooms, potions, or spells. Use rooms to upgrade your dungeon so you can lure more would-be heroes in & do more damage to them. Items and spells can be used to help heroes in the dungeons of other players. If you can do enough damage, you’ll defeat the hero & earn it’s points. If you don’t, they’ll get through & make it back to town for the next round!
				</p>
				<p class="games">
					Different types of rooms have different loot in them. Each hero is drawn to a different kind of loot, so set your dungeon up, replace or upgrade rooms, & try to get the highest amount of loot for the heroes available. Be careful, though, because any hero you can’t defeat in your rooms will count as a wound. Any player that ends a turn with 5 wounds will die. Killing heroes will gain you different numbers of souls. The last player alive, or the first one to 10 souls wins the game!

				<p class="games">
					Marvel Champions is what's known as a living card game. This means the core set gives you everything you need to build your starting decks and expansions add new heroes or villains and cards to add into your decks. Unlike collectable card games, packs don't have random cards to chase. You will still construct a deck for each hero and they all have specific cards, like Iron Man's armor. Cards can be swapped out, so the decks aren't fixed & you can make adjustments if you find there's a card you don't use often enough or just want to try something else.
				</p>
				<p class="games">
					The game plays out with the villain having its own deck with different types of cards to play. Some are scheme cards representing their evil plans, some are henchmen, and some are direct attacks. Players use a power called Thwart to overcome the schemes & remove them from play, including any lingering effects they have. Players can also use their attack power, or that of any allies they have in play, to directly damage the boss or his minions. Each person's turn a new villain card will be played and its up to the players to decide what to deal with first. Once the villain has taken enough damage they will switch to a different version & give the players a new set of challenges until they ultimately save the day!

				<h2>Style: Competitive</h2>
				<h2>Players: 2-4</h2>
				<p class="games">
					Who doesn't want to be a Viking chief? In Champions of Midgard that's exactly the goal! This is what's known as a "worker placement" game, the idea being that the board has various stations to perform certain tasks. On their turn, each player may place one of their workers on an available station to collect resources or send their warriors into battle against an enemy of the village! Make decisions wisely, most board locations can only be used once per round! Each round the players take turns assigning all of their workers & collecting resources along the way. Any warriors used to attack an enemy must be assigned when you place your worker, but combat doesn't happen until the end of the round. Once combat is over, each player collects their workers from the board & all of the stations get reset. After eight rounds the players take turns counting up bonus points & the player with the highest score is the new Chief!
				</p>
				<p class="games">
					Your viking warriors are represented by dice of different colors, some of which can't be used against certain enemies. Enemies take the form of a Troll, two Drauger, and up to four Monsters. Defeating the different enemies gives you rewards like gold & glory. You can also try for secret bonuses from Fate cards that might get you extra glory at the end of the game. There is also the dreaded blame! If a Troll goes undefeated then all the players get a blame token that reduces their score at the end of the game. The points you lose ramp up with each blame token, but if you're the one to defeat the Troll that round, you can give one of your blame tokens to another player.

				<h1 class="games">Cthulhu: Death May Die</h1>
				<h2>Style: Co-operative</h2>
				<h2>Players: 1-5</h2>
				<p class="games">
					Elder Gods, time travel, dark rituals, detailed mini figures. What more could you want? Death May Die has players pick an adventurer from various points in time to interrupt a ritual to summon an Elder God into our world. The Old One is still coming either way, its too late to stop it completely. The best humanity can hope for is to keep them from coming back fully powered so they can be killed in the brief moment they are vulnerable. Are you up to the task?
				</p>
				<p class="games">
					The game is episode based, each episode being a different scenario & ritual for the players to disrupt. The episode dictates placement of the map tiles & details of what the players need to do to interrupt it. Players move through the rooms to explore & at the end of the turn, if the room they're in has an enemy, they have combat. If the room is epmty they can investigate to look for clues or items to help in thier mission. Finally they pull a Mythos card to see where new monsters or cultists show up & if the Old One moves closer to our world. Each of the characters has 3 powers to use, too. As you progress through the mission you'll start losing sanity. At certain sanity levels you'll be able to level up those powers to make them stronger so you can do more damage, run without enemies following you, or use special symbols on your dice rolls. Each character has one unique power & two generic abilities, but are also dealt a random character flaw card at the start of the game that will change how you play the game.

				<h2>Style: Both</h2>
				<h2>Players: 3-7</h2>
				<p class="games">
					Your team is trapped on a lunar mining base, but something more than ore was waiting in those mines. Something that infected members of your crew. Part of the problem is that you’re not sure who is infected. Is it the medic? Maybe the shield technician? Is it the Commander? The other big problem is that systems are failing around the base, some are normal parts of the operation, but some could be sabotage. One thing’s for sure, you’re going to have to work together if you’re going to hold the base together long enough for the rescue team to arrive. The tasks necessary will be tough enough, but it gets a lot harder when you don’t know who you can trust!	
				</p>
				<p class="games">
					At the beginning of the game players choose which member of the crew they want to be. Once everyone has a character, you all get a card that tells you if you’re a normal human or an infected traitor. Everyone has to take 30 seconds to look at their card & can’t put it down until the timer runs out, that way no one knows whether the other players are traitors or not. Players have a dice pool to represent their resources & keep those dice behind a blind, so the type, quantity, and value of each of their rolls are hidden. On each player’s turn they may attempt to complete challenges & other players can choose to help or not. If they do decide to help, they have to contribute at least one die to the total for the challenge. Be careful, though, because all dice have positive and negative numbers on them, so if you roll poorly you may end up hurting the team instead! But maybe you are infected and that was your plan all along! Complete enough challenges & you survive long enough to be rescued, but if you fail too many or enough components of the base are destroyed then your whole crew is lost!

				<h2>Style: Competitive</h2>
				<h2>Players: 3-5</h2>
				<p class="games">
					Have you ever wanted to be one of the great heroes from DC Comics, and maybe take on a super villain with the powers of the Justice League? Well, in this deck building game, you can! DC Deck Building Game is exactly what it says it is. It is a deck building game where each player will get to be one of the many heroes from the Justice League. There are several expansions for this game, so if the original heroes don’t fit your style and you want to be someone else, there are plenty to choose from!
				</p>
				<p class="games">
					Each player starts the game with ten cards to form their player deck, and they will be labelled as “Kick” and “Punch”. These cards will have a “power” assigned to them. This power is on most of the cards in the game and will vary based on what card it is. You will use this power to claim cards from the main lineup, or attack the Super Villain. Once this is complete, you will discard any unused cards and any new cards you acquired, then draw the next five cards from your player deck. The next player then takes their turn in the same order. This goes around the table for the entirety of the game.
				</p>
				<p class="games">
					The game concludes when all of the Super Villains have been defeated. Once this is complete, all players will add up the cost value on their cards to see who has the most. This counts as your points. The player with the most points wins.

				<h2>Style: Competitive</h2>
				<h2>Players: 3-5</h2>
				<p class="games">
					In Dungeon Roll the players each get a party leader card with a bonus power. At the start of the round they roll the Party dice to see which types of heroes make up their party. In addition to the hero types, they may also roll potions which can be used to bring dice that were already discarded, and scrolls that can be used to reroll any number of dice. Players then enter the dungeon on level one, where another player takes on the job of rolling for monsters. Level one they roll one Monster die, level two is two Monster dice, etc. Use your party dice to defeat monsters, open treasure chests, or take potions to complete the levels. Certain treasures can also be used as hero types if you have them. Take your party as far as you dare & collect experience for the last level you completed. Plan wisely, if you decide to try another level and can’t complete it, you lose any experience you would have gained!
				</p>
				<p class="games">
					The character cards all have a basic power, but if you reach level 5 you can flip the card to the upgraded version for a more powerful ability. The Monster dice also have a dragon symbol, and if you end up with 3 of them, you have to face the dragon before you can take on the other monsters or collect rewards. Dragons require 3 different hero symbols to defeat, but you can experience and treasure immediately, regardless of the rest of that level. Everyone gets 3 turns to collect as much experience as possible, so dive as far as you can in the dungeons and collect as much treasure as you can!

					Based on the Cthulhu Mythos, In this cooperative game the players are investigators working together to stop an evil cult from summoning an Old One to our world. Explore the locations of the museum to recover common, unique, or magic items, clue tokens, portals to Other Worlds, or the titular Elder Signs. If you find enough Elder Signs in time, you can prevent the ritual, otherwise you have to do battle with the Old One itself to try & stop it from driving the world mad!
				</p>
				<p class="games">
					Players pick an investigator with a special ability & starting items. As you explore the museum you’ll need to complete tasks to gain rewards or defeat monsters. These tasks are represented by different symbols that correspond to the sides on the dice. Players roll the dice & try to match the symbols to complete objectives on the location cards. If you can finish a task, place the dice you need on the card & roll any dice you have left to try to complete any other task on that location. If you can’t complete any of the tasks, you lose one of your dice, but you can try again with any dice you have left. If you complete all the tasks you collect rewards & return to the gift shop. If you run out of dice before completing all the tasks, you’ll take physical or mental damage.

					Want to play mad scientist? That's the theme of Gizmos. This is an "engine builder" game, so the idea is to have multiple gizmo cards that trigger chain reactions based on which action you take on your turn. Each gizmo has a different trigger & effect, so plan accordingly! There are 3 levels of Gizmos to build with stronger powers and worth more victory points, but also at an increased cost. Play lasts until someone builds their 3rd level 3 gizmo, or 16 total gizmos. Then everyone counts up their victory points & whoever has the most wins the blue ribbon at the science fair!	
				</p>
				<p class="games">
					Resources take the form of colored marbles, representing different power sources. The different colors are used to pay for the gizmo cards, but the colors don't have unique powers by themselves. Gizmo powers are triggered by either picking up a specific color marble, building a colored gizmo, or just by taking certain actions. Powers range from upgrades to your resource capacity, picking extra marbles, or converting one color marble to another, to making gizmos cost less or getting extra victory points for building certain colors. You only get one action by default, but plan your gizmos right & you may end up taking 6-7 in one turn or building something & gaining more marbles than it cost to buy it!

				<h2>Style: Co-operative</h2>

				<p class="games">
					Legendary is a deck building card game based on the Marvel comic universe. In this game, you take the role of a SHIELD agent trying to recruit as many heroes as possible to defeat an evil Mastermind and his schemes of taking over the world.
				</p>
				<p class="games">
					As you start the game you only have SHIELD Agents who give you recruiting power and SHIELD Troopers who give you attack power. You will use your purchase power to buy more powerful hero cards and build a stronger deck. Different heroes have different powers that can give you bonuses when played  together. As you progress, you will continue to build your deck and fight off henchmen, save bystanders, and eventually thwart their master plan.
				</p>
				<p class="games">
					The turns are broken down into 3 steps: Villain phase, recruit and battle phase, and then cleanup. Rinse and repeat until the players knockout (KO) the mastermind four times. The players then count up points based on all of the cards they accumulated over the course of the game. Win or lose together, but whoever has the most points at the end is the best hero!

					The city of Waterdeep is one of the most iconic locations 
					in the Forgotten Realms of Dungeons & Dragons. In this game 
					you play one of the unseen Lords, controlling the city & its 
					people from the shadows. There are times you will work with 
					the other Lords to achieve a task, sometimes you'll work 
					against them, and sometimes they'll throw a surprise to try 
					and stop you!
				</p>
				<p class="games">
					This is a worker placement game with many options each turn 
					to assign your workers to. Should you recruit adventurers to 
					send on quests? Maybe you should construct a new bulding? 
					Would it be a better time for espionage & trickery? Each 
					location on the board will help you gain resources, but most 
					can only be used by one player per round. You have to plan 
					carefully to make the most of your turn, but since each player 
					can only place one worker at a a time you have to be flexible 
					in case someone else takes a space before your turn. You have 
					eight rounds to achieve your goals. Can you score enough 
					points to become the most powerful Lord in the city?

				<p class="games">
					Would you rather trade goods or steal them? Make that decision here, just like the title says! This game is a bit more complex, as there are many options available to players each round. Each player has a ship & starts off with goods for trade. The board has many ports the players can sail to, and each one has different goods in demand, ship upgrades, and a different empire that controls the port. Sell your goods for gold, buy more to fill your cargo hold, then sail on to another port! There are also missions available if you’re feeling bold! They offer various rewards like ship upgrades, gold, or a whole new ship! Take care where you sail, though, because pirates sail the high seas looking for merchants to rob!
				</p>
				<p class="games">
					Speaking of pirates, that’s an option for you, too. If you don’t like the slow route to build up your gold, you can always attack your fellow players & steal theirs! Attacking other ships will give you a bounty from that empire and you can’t dock in a port controlled by that empire, but there are always other places to dock. The roaming pirates won’t attack you, but there are ships from the fleets around, if you’re spotted by a ship under a flag you have a bounty from, they will attack you! Plan your routes carefully to avoid the armada or take cover in a port where all players are safe. Completing missions, uncovering rumors, turning in high value goods, and winning combat all reward Glory points, as does stashing gold to keep it safe from pirates. Try to get to 10 Glory first & show everyone you’re the best Captain in the sea!

					Basically, this is Dungeons and Dragons “Lite”. Each player starts at level 1 and fight their way up to level 10. In doing so, they will have special armor, weapons, potions, and other things to help them along the way.
				</p>
				<p class="games">
					You start the game with both door cards and treasure cards; there are also two stacks of cards on the table, both doors and treasure. As the player, you put down any armor, weapons, or other items that can help you along the way - all using the same rules as most role playing games (1 armor, 2 hands, 1 headgear and so on). The main difference between most role playing games and this one is that this is a cooperative game, as well as a competitive game since you can attack other players to stop them from winning.
				</p>
				<p class="games">
					Your turn starts by you kicking down the door from the door stack that everyone can see. If it is a monster or a curse, that card takes effect immediately; otherwise, you keep it in your hand. You can then “look for trouble” (fight a monster card you have in your hand) or “loot the room” (draw another door card only you can see). One this order is complete, you discard your hand down to 5 cards and it is the next player’s turn. You gain levels by defeating monsters or by “gain a level” cards. This continues around the table until one of the players reaches level 10.

					Players get four actions each turn that they can use to move, treat infections, trade cards, or develop the cure to a disease. After these actions they draw two cards for their hand, then play a number of cards from the infection deck based on the current threat level. The regions of the world have different colors of diseases that naturally occurs there & that is reflected on the cards in the players’ hands. If you can match 5 cards of the same color, you can go to a city with a research station to develop the cure! Cure all 4 diseases and save the world!

				<h2>Style: Competitive</h2>

				<p class="games">
					This card game is based on Dungeons & Dragons, with a twist. Instead of beginning a campaign & working together to stop evil forces, you're jumping in at the end when you & the rest of your party has just defeated the dragon in his cave. The lair is full of gold & you're trying to figure out how to divide the loot, but greed has set in & all you can think now is to grab as much as you can and run for the entrance! Everyone has the same idea, so now a multi-wizard duel brakes out as everyone tries to get their hands on the treasure & hold back the other wizards! Wait, why is the party all wizards? Who cares, just get the gold!
				</p>
				<p class="games">
					Each player starts in the middle of the hallway with gold on one end & the entrance on the other. The first person to get 25 gold from the pile & make it to the other end to escape wins! As wizards, you also have a hand of cards for your spells to slow the other wizards down. Each spell has a hand gesture on it, so the turns start just like rock, paper, scissors, except everyone makes a gesture for the spell they want to cast while pointing that spell at the wizard they want to hit. Resolving the timing of certain spells can be tricky, but once it's all sorted out you'll see who moved in which direction, draw new cards, and try again!

					Roll for the Galaxy is a dice and tile strategy game of building space empires. You control a populace that help you explore new territories, develop new technologies, settle alien worlds, produce goods, and ship those goods.
				</p>
				<p class="games">
					All players start the game with a personal game board, five white dice, a blind to roll the dice behind, a cup to help roll the dice, and a player marker. You begin by choosing two face-down starting tiles from the game box, these tiles start your space empire. You also choose two tiles from the bag for your initial setup & choose which technology to develop and which world to settle. Settling worlds give you more dice with different colors, each with their own theme, and worlds can produce goods that can be consumed for victory points or sold for cash. Technologies give you extra powers or rewards when different phases or actions take place.
				</p>
				<p class="games">
					Players take actions simultaneously starting with rolling the dice they have available. The rolls are hidden while you plan what to do with your dice. Players select one phase they want to happen, then arrange their dice according to the rest of the phases they rolled. Once everyone has made their decisions, each player reveals their dice to determine which phases will take place that round. Then everyone goes through each phase one at a time, using the dice they assigned to that phase. Once all the phases are resolved, place any unused dice from that turn back in your cup, use your money to buy back as many used dice as you can, then start another round. Play continues until there are no more victory points left or someone places their twelfth tile, then count up victory points & see who wins!

				<h2>Style: Co-operative</h2>
				<h2>Players: 3-5</h2>
				<p class="games" >
					Sentinels of the Multiverse is a comic book themed 
					multi-player, co-operative, fixed deck card game. This means 
					each player chooses one super hero with it's own card deck 
					and they work together as a team to battle the villain, who 
					also has a deck of cards. Each deck is unique and themed to 
					that character. There is also an environment the battle 
					takes place in, also represented by a deck of cards.
				</p>
				<p class="games">
					Each round begins with the villain turn, followed by the 
					players, and finally the environment. Villains have start 
					of turn effects, play the top card of their deck, then end 
					of turn effects. Players can play a card from their hand, 
					then use a power and finally draw a card. If they don't 
					play a card and don't use a power they can draw an extra 
					card. Some heroes will also have start/end of turn effects. 
					Environments play like villain turns.

				<h2>Style: Competitive</h2>
				<h2>Players: 3-4</h2>
				<p class="games">
					Ever wondered what would happen if robots & ninjas teamed up? How about dinosaurs & ghosts? Maybe plants & zombies are more your style? This is the game where you can try all the team ups you can imagine! There are many decks with their own themes & its your job to put any two decks together.
				</p>
				<p class="games">
					The game revolves around location cards being played. Each player can play one of their minion cards on any location they want. The locations have a threshold number to reach to score them, and each minion is worth a certain amount of points. At the end of each round, count up the points on all minions at each location & if the points on the minions is higher than the target on the location, you assign points to each player based on how many points their minions are worth. You also have action cards that can produce a variety of effects like moving minions to other locations, destroying one entirely, or increasing the power of a minion. If a player gets to 15 points they win!

				<h2>Style: Competitive</h2>
				<h2>Players: 3-4</h2>
				<p class="games">
					In Suburbia players compete to build the best town that draws in the highest population. Each building has its own cost to build, but also grants you benefits like earning you money to upgrade buildings later, or increase your reputation. In many ways it resembles the SIm City games, only played in a competitive, table-top format. Cities can also interact with each other in some ways and there are some common goals players can work towards for bonuses.
				</p>
				<p class="games">
					Each player has their own city area, and the buildings come as hexagonally shaped tiles. When you build a new structure, you place its tile so that the edges line up with at least one existing tile in your town. Planning is key, as some structures adjacent to others can give benefits to your reputation, while others may harm it. While money is certainly necessary to create a sprawling metropolis, a good reputation is what’s going to draw people in to increase your population!

					Your team are members of an agency that tries to preserve timelines. You’ll get assignments that send you to the past, the future, or even other dimensions, as you try to solve a mystery & avert disaster! The method of time/dimension travel is to actually send your consciousness into the body of someone else. You’ll have to use that person’s abilities to explore & communicate with the locals to figure out what’s been going on & how to stop it, but be careful, because many of the characters you control will have weaknesses as well!
				</p>
				<p class="games">
					Players have a map to explore with many unique locations to visit. Each location has a group of cards that form a panoramic image with different areas to investigate. You never know where clues will show up or who may have information for you, but don’t take too long searching because you can only stay in these bodies for a limited time! Information on each card is only available to the players who visited that area, so it's up to the team to communicate what they uncover & piece together enough information to save the timeline!

				<p class="games">
					Zombies are everywhere! The outbreak set on the city & you’re one of the last survivors. You know there’s a helicopter pad somewhere & that’s your evacuation point, but you don’t know where it is. It’s up to you and the other players to explore the city to find it & any other tools you may come across along the way.
				</p>
				<p class="games">
					Instead of a normal game board, this one uses tiles for the different areas of town. Each turn the players go through buildings looking for items like weapons, ammunition, or first aid kits. They can also explore new areas by following the road on their tile until they get to the edge. Then they draw a new tile from the stack & place it any way they want as long as the road lines up with the tile they started on. Keep going until you find the helicopter pad. Once the first player boards the helicopter everyone else has one more turn to get on board before it leaves. Don’t get left behind & turned into zombie food!
